# PDF Data Extraction and Processing Documentation

This documentation provides an overview and instructions for using the code that extracts data from a PDF file and processes it.

## Code Overview

The provided code consists of several functions and utility methods:

- `extract_and_process(zip_file_path)`: This function extracts data from a ZIP file containing a `structuredData.json` file. It reads the contents of the JSON file, processes the data, and returns the extracted information as a list.

- `extract_elements_from_json(json_file_path)`: This utility method extracts the elements from a JSON file and returns them as a list. It is specifically designed to handle the `structuredData.json` file.

- `get_data(json_file_path, exception)`: This function retrieves the data from the extracted JSON file. It calls `extract_elements_from_json` to obtain the elements and performs additional processing on the data. If the `exception` parameter is set to 0, it checks for the presence of the substring "Tax %" in the text and returns the data. Otherwise, it returns the data without any exception checking.

## Instructions

Follow these instructions to use the code for PDF data extraction and processing:

1. **Import Dependencies**: Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. The code relies on the following modules: `zipfile`, `json`, `os`, `tempfile`, `logging`, and `re`. Install any missing dependencies using your preferred package manager or `pip`.

2. **Extract and Process Data**:
   - Call the `extract_and_process(zip_file_path)` function, passing in the path to the ZIP file containing the `structuredData.json` file.
   - The function will extract the JSON file from the ZIP, process the data, and return the extracted information as a list.

```python
data = extract_and_process(zip_file_path)
```

3. **Process Extracted Data**:
   - The extracted data will be returned as a list of strings.
   - You can further process or manipulate the extracted data as per your requirements.
   - The provided code includes an example of checking for the presence of the substring "Tax %" in the extracted text.
   - Adjust the code based on your specific processing needs.

```python
for element in data:
    if "Tax %" in element:
        # Perform specific operations or handle the presence of "Tax %" in the text
        # Additional processing instructions go here
```

Remember to modify the code as needed to fit your project's structure and requirements. Ensure that you handle exceptions, logging, and error handling appropriately for your specific implementation.

## Logging
The code includes basic logging functionality to capture and handle exceptions. You can customize the logging configuration and behavior according to your project's requirements.

## Additional Considerations
- Make sure you have the necessary file permissions to read and extract files from the provided ZIP file.
- Handle any potential encoding issues or text manipulation requirements based on the specific PDF content and data structure.

## Conclusion

With the provided code and instructions, you can extract data from a `structuredData.json` file within a ZIP file and process the extracted information according to your project's needs. Modify and extend the code as required to suit your specific use case.
